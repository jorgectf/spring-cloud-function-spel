This example demonstrates routing capabilities of spring-cloud-function when deployed as AWS Lambdas.
It is almost identical to the `function-sample-aws-routing` , so most of what's described it its README applies to this example as well.

The main difference though is that this example uses functional bean definition feature of Spring.

It also uses `MessageRoutingCallback` in place of `spring_cloud_function_definition` and/or `spring_cloud_function_routingExpression`, effectively giving you more flexibility with your routing decisions.
