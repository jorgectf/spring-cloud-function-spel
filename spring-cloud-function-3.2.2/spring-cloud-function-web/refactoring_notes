If a function returns Flux, we must represent output as JSON Array/Collection since we never know how many elements such flux will contain per each invocation.
For that same reason we can't use TEXT/PLAIN as CT

NON-WEB
When sendng collection of objects to function who's input is not collection, the inpt will be converted to flux and the result is alos going to be flux.
That is to ensure that the function is invoked with idividual. . .
