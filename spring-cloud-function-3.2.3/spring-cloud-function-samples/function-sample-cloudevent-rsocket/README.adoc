## Examples of Cloud Events with Spring via RSocket and Apache Kafka

### Introduction
The current example uses spring-cloud-function framework as its core which allows users to only worry about functional aspects of 
their requirement while taking care-off non-functional aspects. For more information on Spring Cloud Function please visit 
our https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function[project page].

The example consists of a Spring boot configuration class 
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/blob/master/spring-cloud-function-samples/function-sample-cloudevent-rsocket/src/main/java/io/spring/cloudevent/DemoApplication.java[DemoApplication]
which contains a sample function which you can interact with following via RSocket and Apache Kafka.

### From RSocket to Apache Kafka

While very similar to https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-function/tree/master/spring-cloud-function-samples/function-sample-cloudevent-stream[spring-cloud-function-stream] example 
there are few interesting variants here worth discussing.
Here we’re introducing a different delivery mechanism. But what really makes it even more interesting is the fact that unlike Apache Kafka or AMQP there is no protocol 
binding defined for RSocket. So we will communicate Cloud Event in a structured-mode where the entire event is encoded into some type of structure (e.g., JSON).

Few implementation details are also defer in this example from the others. However these details are not relevant in any way to Cloud Event, rather 
demonstration of other mechanisms you may chose to write your code. For example we’ll be using `Consumer` instead of a `Function` and will be manually 
sending an output message using `StreamBridge` component provided by Spring Cloud Stream framework.

So, here is our application code

```
@Bean
public Consumer<Person> hire(StreamBridge streamBridge) {
  return person -> {
    Employee employee = new Employee(person);
    streamBridge.send("hire-out-0", CloudEventMessageBuilder.withData(employee)
	.setSource("http://spring.io/rsocket")
	.setId("1234567890")
	.build());
  };
}
```
Note how we’re utiliziing CloudEventMessageBuilder to generate output Message as Cloud Event.

What we will be sending over RSocket is structured representation of Cloud Event:
```
String payload = "{\n" +
	"    \"specversion\" : \"1.0\",\n" +
	"    \"type\" : \"org.springframework\",\n" +
	"    \"source\" : \"https://spring.io/\",\n" +
	"    \"id\" : \"A234-1234-1234\",\n" +
	"    \"datacontenttype\" : \"application/json\",\n" +
	"    \"data\" : {\n" +
	"        \"firstName\" : \"John\",\n" +
	"        \"lastName\" : \"Doe\"\n" +
	"    }\n" +
	"}";
```
So, the entire Cloud Event is represented as JSON sent over RSocket to the hire() function.

```
rsocketRequesterBuilder.tcp("localhost", 55555)
	.route("hire")        // target function
	.data(payload).       // data we're sending
	.send()
```
