This sample uses the custom runtime type on AWS lambda using @Bean style configuration. 
However, changing configuration to functional bean registration is supported as well and shown in `function-sample-aws-custom` example.

To run the app in AWS choose the "Custom Runtime" runtime type, and upload the
.zip file that gets built on the command line with `mvn package` (look
in `target`).  
There are several functions defined in the `com.example.LambdaApplication`, so identify the selected function in "Handler"
You can also use function composition (e.g., `uppercase|reverse`)

You can test any function in this example with any String as input, but the Lambda UI only allows valid JSON as
test data, so you will have to escape the input with double quotes.
