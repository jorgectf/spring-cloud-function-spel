This sample uses the custom runtime type on AWS lambda using function bean registration style configuration. 
However, changing configuration to @Bean registration is supported as well and shown in `function-sample-aws-custom-bean` example.

To run the app in AWS choose the "Custom Runtime" runtime type, and upload the
.zip file that gets built on the command line with `mvn package` (look
in `target`).  
There is a single function defined in the `com.example.LambdaApplication` - `uppercase` which you would typically 
identified as "Handler", but since it's the only one any value would do, so keeping default "hello.handler" is fine.

You can test it with any String as input, but the Lambda UI only allows valid JSON as
test data, so you will have to escape the input with double quotes.
